# Devanagari-Handwritten-Character-Recognition

This is a Devanagari-Handwritten-Character-Recognition Project.
This project helps you classify different alphabets of hindi language (Devanagiri) using Convnets

 I have used convolutional neural networks. I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
